# VocantasticApp
Vocantastic App is an interactive learning app for Android created in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. This app allows users to learn a foreign language by adding word pairs in both native and foreign languages, saving them, and making a list of them so the user can search and learn them. The app uses SQLite and Shared Preferences databases to store the data. It includes two tests - one where the user chooses the right answer from a list and another where the user solves an anagram and displays the user's test scores. Additionally, the app includes a flashcard learning option for the created word pairs to help the user in studying. The app follows Material Design 3 and is compatible with Android 12 (API 31).

# Features
